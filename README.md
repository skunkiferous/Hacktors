Hacktors
========

This is a *simple* demo that should exemplify how something similar to a
multiplayer version of Hack could be programmed with JActors and clustered on
Apache Felix.

It is meant to demonstrate different technologies, and not to create the deepest gameplay.
The code should stay as simple as possible, os it keeps an "educational value".

Phase 0 (the current phase):

* Create a simple working prototype, using the usual Java coding model.

Phase 1:

* Convert the code to use JActors, support persistence,  and be multi-threaded.

Phase 2:

* Convert the code, so that it can work in Apache Felix, an OSGi container.

Phase 3:

* Using the appropriate JActor APIs, make the code distributed, and add multi-player support.

Phase 4:

* Convert the code, to allow dynamic extension of the core through thrid-party, uncoordinated, extentions.
